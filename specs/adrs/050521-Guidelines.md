# Preparing Guidelines

## Context and Problem Statement
C: We want to craft coding and workflow guidelines that are appropriate for our project.

P: Which official coding guidelines (HTML/CSS, JS) to pick from and refine? How should our Github workflow be?

## Considered Options 
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) HTML Style Guide and Coding Conventions
* [informIT](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24011&seqNum=3) HTML Coding Guidelines
* [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html) HTML/CSS Style Guide
* [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) JavaScript Style Guide() {
* [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) JavaScript Style Guide
* [Mozilla](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html) JavaScript Guideline from MDN Web Docs
* [Github](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) Visual Guide
* [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/github-flow) Detailed Guide
* Create our own Github workflow

## Decision Outcome
Chosen options: Google HTML/CSS Style Guide; Mozilla JS Guideline; Create our own Github workflow with our own experience, because

* Google HTML/CSS Style Guide is comprehensive on both HTML and CSS. The guide goes into just enough depth that we can still get some good rules out even after trimming.
* Mozilla JS Guideline provides a simple and general set of rules that are immediately applicable to our project, which is relatively short-lived compared to a regular company's. It summarizes JS basic concepts well while guaranteeing efficiency.
* We have some experience in basic Github workflows that worked well in the past. It is good experience for us to apply our expectations of the project to designing a flexible workflow. It's also hard to find a workflow that covers our unique situation.
* Moreover, we include the original guides along with extra Github articles for other members to explore.
