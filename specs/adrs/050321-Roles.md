# [Assigning Roles] 

## Context and Problem Statement
We want to assign roles for the project. 
How should we divide up people to cover the project. 

## Considered Options 
- Splitting up by language (HTML, CSS, JS) 
- Splitting up by features/page (Monthy Log, Daily Log, etc) 
- Subteams 
  - Front-end (HTML, CSS, UI, JS) 
  - Back-end (database, CRUD, JS)
  - Logistics (communication, overall management) 
  - Repo Management (GitHub, CI/CD Pipeline) 
  - Testing (GitHub Actions, Unit Testing, later labs) 

## Decision Outcome
Subteams of 2, each with a team leader who acts as a point of contact with the team leads. These roles can be flexible and people can join/leave a group accordingly. We chose this option because Sanat recommended it to us and we assigned roles/leaders based on communication skills and team-member's interests. 

- Front-end Team: 
  - Lead: Karen Gong 
  - Team-Member: Marlon Trujillo

- Back-end Team 
  - Lead: Dennis Luc 
  - Team-Member: Zak Alhomsy 
 
- Logistics 
  - Team Leads: Navika Budhraja & Bruce Haidrey 

- Repo Management 
  - Lead: Bao Nguyen 
  - Team-Member: Dante Tanjuacto 

- Testing 
  - Lead: Chongbo Tang 
  - Team-Member: Jinhao Zhou
